"""
For the purposes of signal creation, caches must be loaded when the server
imports everything. You probably created a cache in a module Django doesn't
know about. Just explicitly import this module in the models.py or
models/__init__.py of some installed app.

For future signals, files in models.py under any INSTALLED_APPS are
automatically imported. Also, in our code, views.py tend to be as well.

The cache in question has emptied itself for safety, so nothing has caught on
fire, but please address this issue.

Another possibility is that esp.urls is being imported. This calls
admin.autodiscover() and interferes with the cache loading mechanism because
Django lacks a well-thought-out signal mechanism. If you need esp.urls, move
things around so that you don't.
